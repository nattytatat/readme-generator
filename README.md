## Description​

A simple application using Node.js, that generates a professional looking readme file using the command line.

The user is able to cycle through a selection of questions, that upon completion writes a .md file named 'GENERATEDREADME' to the dist folder.

This application uses the File System to access the command line and write the new file. The inquirer package is added for user input functionality to run the questions through the prompt.

Create your professional README file from scratch the **_easy way_**!
